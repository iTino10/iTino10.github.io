<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<mark>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</mark><br>
<u>175g of tahini</u><br>
6 sundried tomatoes<br>
Half a red pepper<br>
A pinch of cayenne pepper<br>
1 clove of garlic<br>
A dash of olive oil<br>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p><mark>Remove the skin from the garlic</mark>, <u>and chop coarsely</u>
Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely
Add all the ingredients into a food processor
Process all the ingredients into a paste.
If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time
If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</p>

<strong>For a different flavour</strong>, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.

Storage

Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

<blockquote>is suitable for freezing</blockquote>; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
